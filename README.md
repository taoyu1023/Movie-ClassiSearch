# 1. Data Acquisition

## 1.1 Using TMDB API

Objective: Retrieve essential information such as titles, overviews, and genres of movies from TMDB.

Tools/API: TMDB API (provided by The Movie Database).

Key Points:

API Application and Quotas: Apply for an API Key from the TMDB website and understand the limits for free accounts.

Scope of Data Retrieval:

Search for movies by keywords;

Get movie lists by genre (e.g., action, comedy, sci-fi);

Filter by time range (e.g., release year);

Retrieve detailed movie information, including title, overview, genres, rating, etc.

Data Fields:

Essential fields: title (title), overview (overview), genres (genres).

Optional fields: id (movie ID), release_date (release date), vote_average (rating), popularity (popularity).

Optional Solution: For small-scale data, use sample datasets provided by TMDB or manually curate a portion of the data.

Notes:

Adhere to TMDB API usage policies to avoid API Key suspension.

# 2. Data Preprocessing and Index Construction

## 2.1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Remove Noise: Strip HTML tags, special symbols, etc.

Tokenization: Tokenize text fields like overviews; for English, use tools like NLTK or spaCy; for other languages, use relevant tools.

Case Normalization: Convert text to lowercase or retain the original case, depending on the requirement.

Stopword Removal: Remove common meaningless words (e.g., "the," "a," etc.).

Stemming / Lemmatization: For English overviews, perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce feature dimensions.

## 2.2 Index Construction

Custom Index:

Inverted Index: Map keywords to relevant movie IDs.

Data Structure: term -> [list_of_movie_ids].

Storage: Implement with Python + SQLite or JSON files, or use professional tools like Lucene.

Search Engine System:

Use mature solutions like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr, which support various search algorithms and ranking features.

# 3. Search and Ranking

## 3.1 Search Methods

Boolean Search: Support AND / OR / NOT operations.

Vector Space Model: Compute TF-IDF or BM25 scores to measure the similarity between movie overviews and queries.

Embedding-Based Search:

Use sentence embedding models (e.g., Sentence Transformers or BERT) for semantic search.

Suitable for achieving high-quality semantic matching.

## 3.2 Ranking Methods

Traditional Information Retrieval Scoring: Rank results based on TF-IDF or BM25 scores.

Fusion of Additional Features:

Movie rating (vote_average);

Popularity (popularity);

Release date (newer movies receive higher weight).

Learning to Rank:

Use machine learning models to combine multiple ranking features if annotated data is available.

# 4. Query Classification Model

Objective: Classify user queries by theme or genre to enhance search efficiency.

## 4.1 Preparing Training Data

Manual Labeling: Categorize queries into genres (e.g., "action," "comedy," "sci-fi").

Automatic Labeling: Infer query categories using movie genres or tags and clean the data accordingly.

## 4.2 Model Training

Traditional Machine Learning Methods:

Convert queries to vectors using TF-IDF or Bag of Words.

Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression or SVM.

Deep Learning Methods:

Fine-tune pre-trained models (e.g., BERT) for short text classification, usually achieving better accuracy.

## 4.3 Application Scenarios

Workflow:

User inputs a query.

The classification model predicts the genre (e.g., "action").

Search the corresponding index based on the genre.

Return sorted results.

Fallback Mechanism: When classification is uncertain, search all indices and merge results.

# 5. Front-End Interface and System Integration

## 5.1 Front-End Interface

Implementation Tools: React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/JS.

Features:

Input search keywords or queries.

Display search result lists:

Title, overview (with truncation if needed);

Genre, rating, release date;

Links to movie detail pages.

Support keyword highlighting.

## 5.2 Back-End API

Framework: Flask / Django / FastAPI (Python), Spring Boot (Java), Node.js, etc.

Workflow:

The front-end sends the query to the back-end.

The back-end invokes the classification model to determine the query genre.

The back-end searches the corresponding index or database for results.

Results are sorted and returned as JSON.

The front-end renders the results.

## 5.3 Performance and Deployment

Performance Optimization:

Use caching to reduce redundant queries.

Configure load balancing to support high concurrency.

Real-Time Updates:

For real-time or near-real-time updates, enable index refresh in Elasticsearch.

Front-End and Back-End Separation: Facilitates scalability and maintenance.

# Summary

The core workflow of building a movie classification and search project based on TMDB includes:

Data Acquisition -> 2. Data Preprocessing and Index Construction -> 3. Search and Ranking -> 4. Query Classification Model -> 5. Front-End Input and Result Display.
